### Welcome to howtoscience.net!

Let's not beat around the bush: scientific writing is hard. It's a skill, and like all skills worth learning, it takes a lot of time and practice to get it right. However, that doesn't mean there aren't short-cuts you can take on the way.

I taught science and scientific report writing for years at an Australian university and I found that the major problems most of my students had were that they really weren't sure of exactly what they should be putting (and in many cases, _not_ putting) into their papers.

Part of the problem is that most students have never even read a scientific paper before. Real papers are very dense, often dry, and always full of jargon that undergraduates dont yet have the knowledge-base to fully understand. This results in a catch-22 situation, where students are being asked to do something that's beyond their grasp because they cannot follow the source material.

However, there is a way to overcome this; and it's by treating scientific writing much like any other form of story-telling. In this site, I use the example of _Star Wars_ to describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure" target="&#x5f;blank">three-act narrative structure</a> and how it can be broadly applied to writing scientific papers. At the same time, I provide examples of how to read past the jargon in real reports and understand their underlying structure.

**What this site is:** a series of pointers aimed at helping you to bypass the jargon and tease out the structure of scientific papers so you can help yourself to improve your writing through understanding.

**What this site is not:** an encyclopedic, step-by-step "how to" guide covering every aspect of scientific reporting. This is beyond the scope of the site, and there are plenty of other guides, both on-line and in print that do a more comprehensive job.

I hope that you gain some insight from this aspect of looking at the task of writing reports. I know it certainly improved my abilities in scientific communication.
